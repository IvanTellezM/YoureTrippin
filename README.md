## About You're Trippin'
You're Trippin' is a user-focused web application where users will create an account, where they will select their activity preferences of choice. From their account, a user can create a schedule by typing what they will be doing and a start & end time. The schedule will be displayed for users to keep track of what they want to do for that day. In addition, we were planning on populating the activity pages with data we obtained using the Yelp API. Unfortunately, at the time of this document being typed up, we were unable to obtain data from the Yelp API, so there is no data for those pages.
